        <h1>NL Express Driver - Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p><strong>Last Updated: April 15, 2025</strong></p>

        <p>NL Express Driver ("we", "us", or "our") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our mobile application ("the App").</p>

        <p>By using NL Express Driver, you agree to the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy.</p>

        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>We may collect information about you in a variety of ways, including:</p>
        <ul>

            <li><strong>Location Data:</strong> We collect location data when you grant permission. This is required to support active deliveries within the app.</li>
            <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> Information such as access times, pages viewed, and IP address.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>We use the information we collect to:</p>

        <h2>3. Foreground Location and Tracking</h2>
        <p>While a delivery is in progress, the App uses a foreground service with a visible notification to track the driverâ€™s location in real-time. Location tracking only occurs during active deliveries and stops once the task is completed. This is essential for enabling delivery tracking features and providing timely updates to customers.</p>

        </ul>

        <h2>5. Security of Your Information</h2>
        <p>We implement appropriate security measures to protect your information. However, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure.</p>

        <h2>6. Your Rights</h2>

        </ul>
